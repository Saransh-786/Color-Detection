# Color Detection OpenCV Project 
This is a simple color detection project implemented using the OpenCV library. It allows you to detect and track colors in real-time using a computer's webcam.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.7
OpenCV
NumPy

Customization
You can customize the project by modifying the color_detection.py script. Some possible modifications include:

Adding or removing colors: You can adjust the range of colors to be detected by modifying the color_ranges dictionary in the script. Each color entry consists of a color name and its corresponding lower and upper HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) values.

Changing the video source: By default, the script captures video from the webcam. If you want to use a different video source, you can modify the cv2.VideoCapture() function in the script accordingly.
